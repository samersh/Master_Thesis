abstract = {Google Cardboard is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Google for use with a head mount for a smartphone. Named for its fold-out cardboard viewer, the platform is intended as a low-cost system to encourage interest and development in VR applications. Users can either build their own viewer from simple, low-cost components using specifications published by Google, or purchase a pre-manufactured one. To use the platform, users run Cardboard-compatible applications on their phone, place the phone into the back of the viewer, and view content through the lenses. The platform was created by David Coz and Damien Henry, French Google engineers at the Google Cultural Institute in Paris, in their 20{\%} "Innovation Time Off". It was introduced at the Google I/O 2014 developers conference, where a Cardboard viewer was given away to all attendees. The Cardboard software development kit (SDK) is available for the Android and iOS operating systems; the SDK's VR View allows developers to embed VR content on the web as well as in their mobile apps.Through March 2017, over 10 million Cardboard viewers had shipped and over 160 million Cardboard app downloads had been made. Following the success of the Cardboard platform, Google announced an enhanced VR platform, Daydream, at Google I/O 2016.},

abstract = {Virtual reality has achieved an adequate level of development for it to be considered in innovative applications such as education, training, and research in higher education. Virtual reality offers both opportunities and challenges for the educational sector. One of the challenges of virtual reality technology is the costs associated which have been unaffordable for educational institutes. However, in recent years, computer hardware and software development has made it more feasible to incorporate virtual reality technology into future teaching strategies. Despite the cost challenges, educational benefits of implementing virtual reality remain compelling. This paper explains virtual reality principle and describes the interactive educational environment developed at WMG, the University of Warwick. It also discusses the benefits of using state-of-the-art 3D photorealistic interactive and immersive virtual environment for engineering undergraduates and postgraduate teaching, learning and training.},

abstract = {Goats have always been considered very useful animals. Goats success is related to its excellent adaptability to the diicult mountain conditions, extreme weather and low value feed acceptance, versatile habits and high production considering their size. These are some reasons because goats are among the irst animals to be domesticated. In terms of evolution, goats could be separated by their dispersion area in three large groups: the European, the Asian, and the African. Global goat populations, mainly in Africa and in Asia, have increased for centuries but very strongly in the past decades, well above the world population growth. They are also used for forest grazing, an integrated and alter- native production system, very useful to control weed growth reducing ire risk. Despite some exceptions, no large‐scale efort to professionalize this industry has been made so far. There are consumers for goat dairy products and there is enough global production, but misses a professional network between both. Regarding goat meat, the world leader- ship also stays in Africa and Asia, namely in China, and there is a new phenomenon, the spreading of goat meat tradition through Europe due to migrants from Africa and other places with strong goat meat consumption.},

abstract = {The Oslo agreements proposed a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza existing alongside Israel. However, the refugees right of return and claims to land and property expropriated by Israel during the 1948 were removed from the equation, although they represent the core issues in the conflict. Based on the territorial divisions that preceded the 1967 war, or the green line, the agreements implicitly rendered the 1948 war and its consequences for the majority of the Palestinian population a non-negotiable historical reality. In a manner of speaking, the crowning of the state (PA) dethroned the nation. In this paper, I review these processes in which refugees have been dismissed, and relegated as relics of an unredeemable past and not as subjects of history in the past-present and whose participation is fundamental in seeking a resolution to the conflict. Based on anthropological research in the region, I argue that, despite the passage of time, refugees continue to hold on to their rights and dream of return, albeit reshaped by the contingencies of exile. I conclude by suggesting that the Israeli state and society must take political, legal and practical responsibility for the refugee problem. This implies that the right of return, decolonization and de-Zionization are inseparable processes.},

The negative affects of this violent occupation—fear, threat, humiliation—quell hope, setting limits on the potentials of political agency. This article documents the corporeality of the Occupation in Hebron, evoking the body as materially contingent to explore agential capacities within the delimiting affects of the violent sensorium. Drawing on fieldwork with Palestinian activists engaged in providing political tours of Hebron, I argue that by reappropriating the violent affects of occupation, this form of activism demonstrates agency that resists “political depression”. Theoretically, I argue further, at hand is an empirical account of the “autonomy of affect” giving rise to critical hope amid a sensorium of fear. The research presented, therefore, contributes to addressing a key question for resistance in Palestine (and beyond): how fear—a predominant affective register of contemporary politics—might be harnessed towards (renewed) political agency and resistance to oppression.},

The Checkpoint is a large complex of corridors, turnstiles, metal detectors and security desks that control the movement and mobility of these workers every day, subjecting them to enforced waiting, stress and absence from the home. In this article we examine the Checkpoint as a regulatory site of Israeli state biopolitics that, by distributing bodies and affects is productive of particular subjects and practices. We articulate our approach to biopolitics through a focus on bodies, discipline and affect before drawing on research visits to give an account of how the space of Checkpoint 300 enacts corporeal and affective discipline. We discuss the Checkpoint as a complex space that is functional, hierarchical and subjectivising and propose that the Checkpoint produces and governs a heteronormative sexual division of labour that is conducive to Israeli state biopolitics by a) upholding patriarchal relations and b) producing a docile male Palestinian labour force to build settlements for the Israeli population. We thus argue that the subject-making processes at Checkpoint 300 work to differentiate and govern Palestinian bodies in ways that are tied to the broader biopolitical objectives of the Israeli state. We close with reflections on the contributions of such an understanding of checkpoints in Palestine and draw attention to the important future lines of inquiry indicated by the research.},

It will first describe research amongst Somalis in Kenyan refugee camps, which demonstrated the importance of transnational networks in the survival of refugees in the camps. The intention of the research set-up was to provide an alternative approach to common depictions of refugees, which often ignore their agency. A focus on agency, referring to every individual's level of choice and power, is as much a methodological decision as a theoretical or epistemological assumption, since people's agency clearly manifests itself in knowledge creation. After describing the possible dialogical nature of academic knowledge creation, the article moves on to illustrate how electronic media can play an important role in this. There are a number of apparent advantages to the methodological use of the Internet and e-mail in research, though at the same time pitfalls should not be underestimated. Nevertheless, when studying refugee communities that are dispersed across the globe and make active use of electronic media, "virtual dialogues "provide fascinating new insights.

In addition to some curricula requiring computing {\&} reasoning and operation {\&} demonstration, the situations of teachers utilizing transparencies, films, and network communications present that digitalized materials have become the mainstream teaching instruments. Creative Thinking Instruction is also largely promoted in school education that various creative teaching strategies are created. Such teaching strategies or models aim to develop and cultivate students' creative teaching abilities through various effective routes and approaches. The effects of teaching approaches and strategies on students' learning achievements and interests as well as the use of distinct teaching strategies and approaches for the promotion of teaching effectiveness are considered as the research motivation. The quasi-experimental research is preceded with the nonequivalent pretest posttest control group design model, where 104 students in two classes in a national university are selected for the experiment. The research results show that 1. Creative Thinking Instruction presents higher sensitivity than general traditional instruction, 2. Creative Thinking Instruction reveals higher fluency than general traditional instruction, 3. Immersion in virtual reality appears the highest sensitivity on Creative Thinking Instruction, and 4. Interaction in virtual reality presents the highest fluency on Creative Thinking Instruction},

This technology has only recently matured enough to warrant serious engineering applications. The integration of this new technology with software systems for engineering, design, and manufacturing will provide a new boost to the field of computer-aided engineering. One aspect of design and manufacturing which may be significantly affected by virtual reality is design for assembly.

abstract = {The idea that technology can transfer a person to a different environment without any physical movement and create the illusion of interaction with the artificial environment is not new. Scientists and engineers have been dedicating their efforts to its progressive development over the last fifty years. However, most of the technological advances have been made in the last ten years, undoubtedly thanks to improvements in computer efficiency and the miniaturization of sensorization devices. Nowadays, virtual reality is successfully applied in different fields, such as telemedicine, robotics or cinematography. Following on from this success, the question arises of whether we are ready to apply it to industrial design and manufacturing processes. The lack of recent reviews on this technology applied to CAD/CAM, together with its rapid evolution over the last decade, have been the primary motivations for carrying out this study. 2006 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

abstract = {In this article we sketch out a geography of hope in Palestine. We focus on 'hyperprecarious' sites, exactly those where exposure to harm is heightened and where thus reasons not to hope seem plentiful. Focusing on fieldwork at such sites, we examine hope as a temporal practice of waiting, attending especially to how a 'moment to come' (kairos) constitutes and affirms anti-colonial practices and topologies of everyday Palestinian life. Hope in the cases we discuss is not simply a positive orientation to the future, but an experience of kairo-logical time that ties hopeful waiting to topo-logical practices that disrupt the space-times of the Israeli occupation, and the horizon of hopelessness it creates for Palestinians. We propose that attending to kairos and topos can therefore reveal the ways that together they can operate as conditions of possibility, as a 'moment' and 'place', for time-spaces to come forth anew, and so as structuring conditions for everyday Palestinian hope for life that is irreducible to the systematic subjugation and violence of the occupation.

By which they meant that, if a place was to be found for Israel in Palestein,where would the people of Palestine go? This is a dilemma that Israel has never been able to resolve.В No conflict today is more dangerous than that between Israel and the Palestinians. The implications it has for regional and global security cannot be overstated. The peace process as we know it is dead and no solution is in sight. Nor, as this book argues, will that change until everyone involved in finding a solution accepts the real causes of conflict, and its consequences on the ground.В Leading writer Ghada Karmi explains in fascinating detail the difficulties Israel's existence created for the Arab world and why the search for a solution has been so elusive. Ultimately,she argues that the conflict will end only once the needs of both Arabs and Israelis are accommodated equally. Her startling conclusions overturn conventional thinking-but they are hard to refute.},

Furthermore , it is unclear whether flow as a construct closely related to immersion offers explanatory power in investigating VR . On the basis of a quantitative survey in a VR center with 294 participants , I analyze the interplay of the key features and exemplify their influence in a VR context by relating them to satisfaction with the VR experience . Using a flow - based conceptualization of immersion , I find that presence as well as interactivity contribute to immersion . In addition , interactivity contributes to presence . Furthermore , my results show that immersion influences satisfaction with a VR experience , indicating that a flow - based conceptualization of immersion is a suitable predictor in VR contexts .},

This collection takes the study of diasporic communication beyond the level of simply praising its existence, to offering critical engagements and analysis with the systems of journalistic production and dissemination as they relate to people who are living outside the borders of their birth nation, offering compelling case studies of production, process and consumption practices. Taking diasporic journalism seriously, as this book does, means examining how diasporic news discourses push back against, and at times reaffirm, existing national and transnational power relations. The 15 chapters in this book explore how diasporic communities engage with local, national, and global processes (social, cultural, governmental) and how diasporic news reflects those linkages.},

abstract = {This review describes the various viruses identified in the semen and reproductive tracts of mammals (including humans), their distribution in tissues and fluids, their possible cell targets, and the functional consequences of their infectivity on the reproductive and endocrine systems. The consequences of these viral infections on the reproductive tract and semen can be extremely serious in terms of organ integrity, development of pathological and cancerous processes, and transmission of diseases. Furthermore, of essential importance is the fact that viral infection of the testicular cells may result not only in changes in testicular function, a serious risk for the fertility and general health of the individual (such as a fall in testosteronemia leading to cachexia), but also in the possible transmission of virus-induced mutations to subsequent generations. In addition to providing an exhaustive account of the data available in these domains, this review focuses attention on the fact that the interface between endocrinology and virology has so far been poorly explored, particularly when major health, social and economical problems are posed. Our conclusions highlight the research strategies that need to be developed. Progress in all these domains is essential for the development of new treatment strategies to eradicate viruses and to correct the virus-induced dysfunction of the endocrine system.},

Using Ivan Sutherland's 'The Ultimate Display' and Moore's law as a springboard, the author discusses both popular scientific and technological accounts of the past, present and possible futures of VR, looking at current research trends, developments, challenges and ethical considerations to the coming age of differing realities. Being Really Virtual is for researchers, designers and developers of VR and immersive technologies and anyone with an interest in the exponential rise of such technologies and how they are changing the very way we perceive, interact and communicate within our digital society.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of mitomycin C, by urologists within the UK, as a single-dose intravesical agent. Current European recommendations are to use one dose after any new tumour resection. METHODS: We assessed the current patterns of mitomycin C usage amongst British urologists, particularly with reference to one instillation after resecting a new bladder tumour, hypothesizing that British urologists would use mitomycin C in line with current guidelines. A one-page questionnaire was mailed to 527 consultant urologists in the UK enquiring about their use of mitomycin C in superficial bladder cancer. A second mailing was sent to encourage nonresponders. RESULTS: Of the 527 consultants, 320 (61{\%}) replied, of which 313 (59{\%}) questionnaires were evaluable. Of these 313 respondents, 299 (95{\%}) used mitomycin C; 244 respondents (82{\%}) advocated the use of one dose of mitomycin C after resecting a new tumour, but only 10 (4{\%}) would use it immediately after tumour resection and 155 (64{\%}) use it within 24 h. Most (98{\%}) respondents favoured the use of a mitomycin C course after resecting multiple tumours or after multiple recurrences. Interestingly, 20 respondents (7{\%}) would use mitomycin C as a first-line therapy for carcinoma in situ and a further 23 (8{\%}) would use it for G3T1 tumours. A minority (14{\%}) would use it after nephrectomy for upper tract transitional cell carcinoma. Almost all respondents indicated a dose of 40 mg in 40 mL of diluent. Maintenance treatment with mitomycin C was advocated by 44 (15{\%}) of respondents, mainly for recurrent multifocal Ta/T1 tumours. The perception of the side-effects of mitomycin C was favourable, with 69{\%} of respondents judging mitomycin C to be well tolerated with mild side-effects. CONCLUSION: Urologists adopt new ideas rapidly, as shown by the wide acceptance of the UK Medical Research Council study. The prompt use of mitomycin C needs to be reinforced, as efficacy is optimum within 6 h of resection. A few consultants persist in continuing with established practices, which have little evidence base. The publication of such survey results, with guidelines for treatment, should encourage those urologists whose practice is at variance from the norm to reflect on and change their practice. 2006 BJU International.},

@book{Volker2013,
abstract = {T he editors of this book, despite some obvious differences, coalesce around a particu- lar set of questions about design. The trajectory by which we arrived at the general positions expressed here varies, but it is not entirely accidental that all have played, and continue to play, roles at the University of Siegen in Germany. The reasons are complex but can be summed up as entailing both epistemological positioning and institutional commitments. All of the contributors to the book share a set of critical convictions about mainstream computing, and these have to do with an interdisciplinary stance (we could equally well gloss it as a “socio-technical” approach). In Germany, as elsewhere, this atti- tude manifested as explicitly opposing a rather traditional, and increasingly problematic, understanding of computer science, one which was also associated with conventional views of mainstream engineering and design methodologies. The majority of the editorial team (Volker Wulf, Markus Rohde, Volkmar Pipek, and Gunnar Stevens) started their exploration into making computer sciences more relevant with respect to societal problems in the real world more than 20 years ago. They wanted to better understand the relationship between societal change, specifically on a micro level, and the design of meaningful IT artifacts in support of the actors involved. Or, to frame their interest in the concepts we promote in this book: they were interested in design-oriented investigations into the often complex interaction between social prac- tices and IT artifacts implemented in their support. Somewhat ambitiously, the aim was, and is, to establish a new research paradigm, but, and all the editors would agree on this, the road has been long (and winding). The inter- ests and commitments of the core Siegen group have developed in a varied institutional context, which includes the University of Bonn; Fraunhofer FIT; the University of Oulu (Finland); Roskilde University (Denmark); the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg; and— last but not least—the International Institute for Socio-Informatics (IISI) in Bonn. Kjeld Schmidt and Dave Randall, as more recently arrived fellow travelers, can trace similar institutional histories. Regardless, over time, we have been developing a set of theoretical, conceptual, and empirical commitments that we, somewhat in jest, like to call the Siegen School. The concept of “practice” and, arguably, just as importantly, the idea of practice-based computing, has become core to these endeavors. We are grateful to colleagues and friends around the world for their intellectual (and other) support. In Siegen we owe much to Erhard Sch{\"{u}}ttpelz. Drawing on the strong local tradition in media studies, he worked out an ambitious program of grounding media research in ethnographical investigations of social practices. Erhard's turn to practices created additional grounding for an extremely fruitful interdisciplinary cooperation. Others have been equally influential. Mark Ackerman, Kari Kuutti, Gerhard Fischer, Peter Br{\"{o}}dner, Batya Friedman, Ina Wagner, Liam Bannon, Susanne B{\o}dker, Geoffrey Bowker, Wayne Lutters, Carla Simone, Antonella de Angeli, Irina Shklovski, Peter Tolmie, Myriam Lewkowicz, Gillian Hayes, Charlotte Lee, Peter Mambrey, Matthias Jarke, Austin Henderson, and Thomas Herrmann have generously supported our work. A design-oriented understanding of the concept of social practice, and the reflections upon it that we consider fundamental, is the result. The evolving research paradigm described in this book is grounded in some twenty- five design interventions that we call design case studies. They took place in a variety of different fields of application and document our engagement with practitioners, typically over a period of years. Various collaborators have been influential in this process. They include, as well as contributors to the book, others such as Helge Kahler, Markus Won, Tim Reichling, Martin Stein, Thomas Ludwig, Nico Castelli, Rainer Wieching, Mar{\'{e}}n Schorch, Christian Reuter, Timo Jacobi, and Walter Sch{\"{a}}fer. We are also indebted to colleagues for administrative support. The administrative load is heavy, since long-term projects usually require external funding, and readers will know what administrative complexities follow on from that. Special thanks, then, to Marietta Krenzer-Gr{\"{a}}b, Karin Ofterdinger, Monika Wagner, Rachel Schneider, Paulina K{\"{u}}hn, Roman Burbach, Christina B{\"{o}}hmer, and Julia Kr{\"{a}}mer, who have all, with astonishing grace and equanimity, dealt with our persistent failings. Practice-based design research is an intellectual and emotional challenge. It is highly collaborative and requires a high, and sustained, degree of engagement. Somewhat guiltily, the editors can attest to the toll that these challenges can take on both colleagues and families. We, therefore, would like to express our deepest gratitude to our partners, children, families, and friends for having stood by us over all that time. This book is yours! Finally, we would like to thank Dan Taber, our lector at Oxford University Press. He enthusiastically embraced the concept of this book and kindly accepted delays in our collaborative writing and editing process. While a first outline of this book was created in the stimulating environment of a Zimbabwean train, it took some 5 years to elaborate on this manuscript.},

abstract = {Since 1993 the international community has invested more than {\$}24 billion in ‘peace and development' in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). That aid was meant originally to support the Oslo Peace Process through economic development. However, neither peace nor development has been realized, and both seem increasingly unlikely. While examining donor operations, priorities and the ‘aid-for-peace' agenda, this article investigates whether patterns in oPt donor aid have changed following the Arab uprisings of 2011. Building on 28 original interviews with Palestine aid actors, it was found that patterns remain unchanged and that donors remain transfixed on a long failed ‘Investment in Peace' framework that was designed for economic development by the World Bank back in 1993. By comparing these research findings with the literature on aid to Palestine, this article argues that donors are not ready to alter a framework dominated by policy instrumentalists who emphasize pre-determined normative values over actual results, quietly trading financial inducements to Palestinians to forgo political rights within a ‘peace dividends' model. Meanwhile, critics of the existing aid framework remain largely ignored and have little influence on aid policy, in spite of two decades of instrumentalist failure to produce peace or economic growth using the existing model.},

This strategy was calculated to allow decolonization to occur on British terms rather than those of the indigenous populations, and thus to keep these soon-to-be former colonies within the British and Western spheres of influence during the Cold War. To achieve this new form of informal liberal imperialism, however, the government had to rely upon the use of illiberal dirty wars.
